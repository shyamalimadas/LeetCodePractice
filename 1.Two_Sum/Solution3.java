 * Intuition

To improve our runtime complexity, we need a more efficient way to check if the complement exists in the array. If the complement exists, we need to get its index. What is the best way to maintain a mapping of each element in the array to its index? A hash table.

We can reduce the lookup time from O(n) to O(1) by trading space for speed. A hash table is well suited for this purpose because it supports fast lookup in near constant time. I say "near" because if a collision occurred, a lookup could degenerate to O(n) time. However, lookup in a hash table should be amortized O(1) time as long as the hash function was chosen carefully.

Algorithm

A simple implementation uses two iterations. In the first iteration, we add each element's value as a key and its index as a value to the hash table. Then, in the second iteration, we check if each element's complement (targetâˆ’nums[i]) exists in the hash table. If it does exist, we return current element's index and its complement's index. Beware that the complement must not be nums[i] itself!

class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            map.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            if (map.containsKey(complement) && map.get(complement) != i) {
                return new int[] { i, map.get(complement) };
            }
        }
        // In case there is no solution, return an empty array
        return new int[] {};
    }
}

/*
 * Complexity Analysis

Time complexity: O(n).
We traverse the list containing n elements exactly twice. Since the hash table reduces the lookup time to O(1), the overall time complexity is O(n).

Space complexity: O(n).
The extra space required depends on the number of items stored in the hash table, which stores exactly n elements.
